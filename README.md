# 18F Posters

This repository contains a set of posters created by 18F staff that emphasize our values and the way we work with partners. These posters can be downloaded and used by any government agency adopting or using similar approaches that want to socialize these ideas with staff.

More information on 18F's [methods](https://methods.18f.gov/) and [principles](https://18f.gsa.gov/partnership-principles/) when working with partners can be found on our website.
